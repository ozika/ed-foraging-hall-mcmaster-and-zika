Welcome to the task code!

This folder has the PsychoPy3 files needed to run the task online, using
a hosting tool such as Pavlovia.

One of the key files is 'foraging_task.psyexp'. 

If you open this file in the Psychopy builder, you can then create a new Pavlovia project and run the task online.

The task will not run in Psychopy alone due to custom Javascript components.
