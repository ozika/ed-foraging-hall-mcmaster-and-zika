The amount of treasure you dig up will decrease the longer you spend on an island. So you will need to decide when to leave each island to sail to a new one.\n\nWe will first ask you for some basic demographic information. We will then ask you to carefully read through the instructions about the game, which will help you earn more money. After that, you will be ready to start.\n\nPlease only participate from a computer (no mobiles, no tablets) and if your screen is at least 13-inch diagonal. Also know that you will need remain in full screen mode for the entire experiment. If you exit full screen mode, there is no guarantee we can compensate you.\n\n\n\nPress space to continue"],

Data from this session will be combined with data from the earlier session of 'Eating attitudes and pirates', for the purposes of investigating relationships bewteen eating attitudes, mental health and decision-making.
